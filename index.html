            "Using Layer Wise Training for Road Segmentation in Autonomous Cars" is a project that focuses on enhancing the capability of 
            autonomous vehicles to accurately identify and segment road surfaces from other elements within their environment. Road segmentation is crucial for 
            autonomous navigation as it allows the vehicle to discern driving lanes, sidewalks, and other road features, thereby ensuring safe navigation. 
            The project employs a deep learning approach known as layer wise training, which involves training a neural network one layer at a time.
             This method addresses challenges like vanishing gradients that can occur during training, thereby potentially improving the 
             efficiency and accuracy of the model.
